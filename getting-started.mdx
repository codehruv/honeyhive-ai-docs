## Getting Started

Our API and SDK are designed to be easy to use and integrate with your existing infrastructure.

Everything you can do via the platform can be done via the API. In these docs, we will just explain the platform flow.

## Create a new project

1. Login to the [HoneyHive platform](https://app.honeyhive.ai) via Google SSO.
2. Create a new project by clicking on the **New Project** button.
3. Give your project a name (optionally type and description as well) and click **Create Project**.

## Add your first prompt

1. Click on the [**Playground**](https://app.honeyhive.ai/playground) tab in the left sidebar.
2. Add a new version name for the prompt (e.g. `v1`, `davinci-basic`, etc.)
3. Type in your prompt with `{{` and `}}` around the variable you want to dynamically insert.
4. Click **Save Prompt**.

## Evaluate your prompt

1. Click on the [**Evaluation**](https://app.honeyhive.ai/evaluate) tab in the left sidebar.
2. Click `Add Dataset` to upload a dataset to evaluate your prompt.
3. Click `Add Metrics` to add a metric to evaluate your prompt.
4. Click `Run Comparison` to run your evaluation.
5. Wait for the evaluation to complete and view the results.
6. Rate the results to begin collecting labelled data.

## Deploy your prompt

1. Click on the [**Prompts**](https://app.honeyhive.ai/prompts) tab in the left sidebar.
2. Select the prompt you want to deploy.
3. Click on the **Deploy** button.
4. Copy the deployment code snippet (which contains your API keys) and paste it into your application.

## Integrate the SDK/API

1. Install the SDK via `pip install honeyhive` or connect via the cURL.
2. Replace your model provider requests with our **Generations** endpoint. More details on this can be found in the [API documentation](/api-reference/generations).
3. Instrument your application to collect user feedback using our feedback API. More details on this can be found in the [API documentation](/api-reference/feedback).

## Monitor your prompt

1. Watch your prompt's performance in real-time on the [HoneyHive platform](https://app.honeyhive.ai/dashboard).
2. Use the [Generations](https://app.honeyhive.ai/datasets/generations) page or API to view the generated text and feedback.
