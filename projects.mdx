In the context of HoneyHive, a project refers to a collection of prompts, models, data, evaluations and metrics that work together to accomplish a specific task for which you're using an LLM. For example, a SQL code generator will be considered a seperate Project vs a SQL code interpreter.

<Tip>It is best to organize each project within your workspace as a separate task for which you're using large language models. This allows you to standardize data structures and schema for each individual project but allows the flexibility to store multiple prompt variants within each Project space.</Tip>

## Create a new project

1. Log in to [HoneyHive](https://app.honeyhive.ai) via Google SSO.
2. Create a new project by clicking on the **Add Project** button.
3. Give your project a name (optionally type and description as well) and click **Create Project**.

<Note>In cases where you're chaining multiple LLMs together, we recommend separating each part of your chain where you use an LLM as a unique project within HoneyHive.</Note>
