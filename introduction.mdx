## What is HoneyHive?

HoneyHive is the **Optimization Platform** that helps you build powerful LLM-powered apps with quantitative rigor and continuously improve them in production. We help you **build, evaluate, deploy, monitor and fine-tune** LLM apps for production use-cases, allowing you to improve model performance & align your models with your usersâ€™ preferences.

Using HoneyHive, your team can continuously iterate on your production LLM apps and evaluate new model-prompt configurations against a wide variety of quantitative metrics before deploying to production. Once in production, we help you discover new insights, behaviors and anomalies by logging and analyzing user feedback, custom metrics and the distribution of your production data with our embeddings and clustering technology. You can use your production logs to quickly fine-tune custom models or curate datasets for fine-tuning or further analysis in your notebook of choice.
