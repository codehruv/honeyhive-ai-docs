HoneyHive is a **model observability and evaluation** platform built for teams using foundation models in production. We help developers **evaluate, deploy, monitor and fine-tune** foundation models for production use-cases, allowing them to continuously improve model performance & align their models with user feedback.

## Key Concepts

1. **Prompt Deployment** - Manage multiple prompts and models for a particular project and deploy them to production with a single click.

2. **Evaluation** - Compare multiple models, prompts and hyperparameter settings against your datasets and metrics to find the best performing model-prompt configurations for your use case.

3. **Monitoring & Analytics** - Capture your model requests, model predictions and user feedback to analyze how your model is performing in production.

4. **Fine-Tuning** - Fine-tune custom models using the data you collect from your users.

## Getting Started

Our API and SDK are designed to be easy to use and integrate with your existing infrastructure.

1. **Create an account** - Create an account with HoneyHive and get your API key.
2. **Create a new project and a prompt** - Create a project upon sign-up and add your first prompt to get started.
3. **Deploy your prompt** - Deploy your prompt to production directly from the platform.
4. **Integrate our SDK** - Replace your OpenAI requests with our **Generate API** endpoint and instrument your application using our SDK or REST API.
