### What is HoneyHive?

HoneyHive is the **collaborative developer platform** that helps you **<a href="#debug">debug</a>**, **<a href="#evaluate">evaluate</a>** and **<a href="#monitor">monitor</a>** your LLM applications so you can go from prototype to production while continuously improving with human feedback, quantitative rigor and safety best-practices.

### Debug
Gain insights into the fine-grained execution of LLM agents and chains with **session tracing**. Session tracing gives you a step-by-step summary of exactly what your agent or chain did and when it did it. This allows you to precisely pinpoint subtle problems in even the most complex LLM applications.

### Evaluate
Evaluate new app versions against a wide variety of **custom metrics** and **AI feedback functions** before pushing changes to production. This helps you debug errors, safely validate app performance and run regression tests before costly errors happen.

### Monitor
Once in production, discover new insights, understand user behavior and detect anomalies across your application. Get started by instrumenting your application to **log completion requests, user sessions, user feedback, custom metrics and user-specific metadata** and creating visualizations of any custom metrics across any data slice.

### Programmatic SDK
Our SDK is designed to be developer-friendly and integrate with your existing infrastructure as well as the larger LLM ecosystem (Langchain, LlamaIndex, Pinecone, Chroma, etc.). 

<Tip>All features within the platform are programmatically accessible via the SDK.</Tip>
