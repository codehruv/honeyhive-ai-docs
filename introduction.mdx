HoneyHive is a **model evaluation and observability** platform that's built for teams working with foundation models. We help companies **evaluate, deploy, and monitor** models in production.

## Core Components

1. **Prompt Deployment** - Manage multiple prompts and models for a particular project and deploy them to production with a single click.

2. **Evaluation** - Compare multiple models and prompts against your datasets and metrics to find the best performing model for your use case.

3. **Data Observability** - Capture user interaction data and model predictions to understand how your model is performing in production.

4. **Fine-tuning** - Fine-tune your model with the data you collect from your users.

## Getting Started

Our API and SDK are designed to be easy to use and integrate with your existing infrastructure.

1. **Create an account** - Create an account and get your API key.
2. **Create a project and prompt** - Create a project and prompt to get started.
4. **Deploy your prompt** - Deploy your prompt from the platform.
3. **Integrate with your app** - Integrate the deployment and feedback ingestion with your app using our SDK or API.
