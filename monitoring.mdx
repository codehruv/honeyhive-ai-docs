title: "Monitor Performance"
description: "Connect your application to HoneyHive and start monitoring model performance in production."

Once you have integrated our SDK to your application and started logging user feedback, you can start observing cost, latency and performance metrics on our Analytics dashboard in real time.

<Note>For certain subscription tiers, we automatically embed all user inputs and model completions for quantitative analysis within HoneyHive.</Note>

## Monitor Performance in Production

1. Watch your prompt's performance in real-time in [HoneyHive](https://app.honeyhive.ai/dashboard).
2. Slice and dice your data using `where` and `group by` filters. Any user properties or custom metadata ingested via the `feedback` endpoint will appear here.
3. Use the [Generations](https://app.honeyhive.ai/datasets/generations) page or API endpoint to view the generated text, user feedback and any custom metadata.

## Observe Data Distribution with t-SNE Embeddings Visualization

Since we automatically embed user inputs and model completions, you can visualize the distribution of your production data and behavior amongst data clusters with our embeddings visualization tool.

<Tip>The chart is by default color-coded by different prompt variants. You can use `group by` filters to group the chart by various features associated with each generation within your project (such as any user metadata, custom metrics or user feedback fields.)</Tip>
