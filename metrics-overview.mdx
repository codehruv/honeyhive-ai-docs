When building LLM apps, performance evaluation is a critical aspect of the development process. Metrics play a vital role in assessing the effectiveness of your apps and ensuring they meet the desired cost, safety, and performance criteria. HoneyHive provides the capability to define custom metrics and set up guardrails tailored to your unique use-case, which can be used to evaluate performance in an offline setting, or when monitoring live data from production. 

This guide will walk you through the process of defining custom metrics and guardrails in HoneyHive, covering how metrics work within the platform and how they can be used to evaluate end-to-end LLM pipelines.

### Why define custom metrics and guardrails

1. **Tailored Evaluation:** Every LLM app is unique, and standard metrics may not fully capture the specific requirements of your use-case. Custom metrics allow you to design evaluations that are aligned with your app's objectives, enabling more relevant and meaningful assessments.
2. **Holistic Assessment:** LLM apps often involve complex pipelines, and evaluating the end-to-end performance is crucial. Custom metrics enable you to assess the entire pipeline, considering various stages of data processing and model interactions.
3. **Cost and Safety Considerations:** In production environments, monitoring the cost of LLM app usage and ensuring safety are paramount. Custom metrics and guardrails can help you keep track of resource consumption and set up safety mechanisms to prevent undesirable outcomes.
