HoneyHive allows you to add, manage and version your prompt-model configurations within each project. To manage your prompts, click on the **Prompts** tab in the left sidebar.

<Note>A prompt-model configuration refers to a combination of prompt, model and hyperparameter settings unique to a particular variant.</Note>

## Add your first prompt

1. You can access the [**Playground**](https://app.honeyhive.ai/playground) within the **Prompts** tab in the left sidebar.
2. Add a version name for your prompt.

<Tip>We typically recommend using a serialized format such as v1.x.x to better organize your prompts.</Tip>

3. Type in your prompt with `{{` and `}}` around the variable you want to dynamically insert. You'll be using these variable names when sending requests to HoneyHive.

<Tip>Dynamic variables can also be used to insert external context from external embeddings databases such as Pinecone or integrated with open-source frameworks such as LlamaIndex.</Tip>

4. Click **Save** to save your changes.

## Automatically optimize your prompts with ðŸª„ Prompt Magic

You can alternatively use our **Prompt Magic** tool to automatically improve your prompt based on feedback provided by you for a given generation.

1. Click **Fork** to start editing a new variant.
2. Add some inputs to generate a response.
3. Click ðŸª„ **Prompt Magic**.
4. Provide feedback critiquing the generation (eg: "Response is too short, uses a lot of jargon").

<Tip>To get the best responses using **Prompt Magic**, we recommend providing highly detailed pieces of feedback to our tool. We use our own LLMs under the hood to automatically improve your prompt.</Tip>

5. Click **Submit Feedback** to automatically improve your prompt.
6. Click **Save** to save your changes or **Undo** to revert back to your original prompt.
