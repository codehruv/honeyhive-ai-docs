HoneyHive allows you to define, version and manage your prompt templates and model configurations within each project. To manage your configs, navigate to the **Prompts** tab in the left sidebar.

<Note>A prompt-model configuration refers to a combination of prompt, model and hyperparameter settings unique to a particular version. Throughout our docs, we may use the term "version" or "prompt template" to refer to a prompt-model configuration.</Note>

### Define your first prompt template

1. You can access the [**Playground**](https://app.honeyhive.ai/playground) within the **Prompts** tab in the left sidebar.
2. Add a version name for your prompt.
3. Choose your application type (Chat or Completions), model provider and hyperparameter settings. We currently offer OpenAI & Anthropic models natively via the Playground, but you can still use your own models to run evaluations and log requests programmatically via the SDK.

<Note>Currently, only OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 models support the chat completions format.</Note>

3. Insert dynamic input variables in your prompt template using curly brackets `{{` and `}}`. You'll be using these variables when logging requests and running evaluations with HoneyHive.

<Tip>Dynamic variables are typically useful when inserting inputs from end-users or external context from tools such as vector databases.</Tip>

4. Click **Save** to save your changes.

### Optimize your prompts with ðŸª„ Prompt Magic

<Note>Prompt Magic is currently in beta and only available to select customers. Please reach out if you'd like access to this feature.</Note>

**Prompt Magic** helps you automatically improve your prompt based on feedback provided by you for a given completion. Let's get started by forking a new prompt template:-

1. Click **Fork** to start editing a new variant.
2. Make some changes to your prompt template and run a request.
3. Click ðŸª„ **Prompt Magic**.
4. Provide feedback in natural language critiquing the response (eg: "Response is too short, uses a lot of jargon").

<Tip>To get the best responses using **Prompt Magic**, provide highly detailed feedback. This helps provide GPT-4 more context to suggest potential improvements to your prompt.</Tip>

6. **Accept** your new prompt or quickly undo any changes.
