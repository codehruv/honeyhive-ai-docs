### Get API key

After signing up on the app, you can find your API key in the [Settings](https://app.honeyhive.ai/settings/account) page under Account.

### Install the SDK

We currently support a native Python SDK. For other languages, we encourage using HTTP request libraries to send requests.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
pip install honeyhive
```
</CodeGroup>

### Trace your LlamaIndex queries

If you haven't already done so, then the first thing you will need to do is <a href="/projects#create-a-new-project">create a HoneyHive project</a>.

Once you have created a HoneyHive project, you can now instrument tracing in your LlamaIndex query as so: 

<CodeGroup>
```python
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleWebPageReader, ServiceContext
from llama_index.callbacks import CallbackManager, LlamaDebugHandler
import honeyhive
from honeyhive.sdk.llamaindex_tracer import HoneyHiveLlamaIndexTracer
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

tracer = HoneyHiveLlamaIndexTracer(
    project="Sandbox - Email Writer",  # necessary field: specify which project within HoneyHive
    name="Paul Graham Q&A",  # optional field: name of the chain/agent you are running
    source="testing",  # optional field: source (to separate production & testing in monitoring)
    user_properties={  # optional field: specify user properties for whom this was ran
        "user_id": "1234",
        "user_country": "US",
    },
    api_key="YOUR_HONEYHIVE_API_KEY",
)
callback_manager = CallbackManager([tracer])
service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(callback_manager=callback_manager)

#
documents = SimpleWebPageReader(html_to_text=True).load_data(
    ["http://paulgraham.com/worked.html"]
)
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
    documents, service_context=service_context
)  # pass the service_context to the index

query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("What did the author do growing up?")
```
</CodeGroup>

You can now view this trace from within the HoneyHive platform by clicking on **Datasets** in the sidebar and then **Traces**.
