### Get API key

After signing up on the app, you can find your API key in the [Settings](https://app.honeyhive.ai/settings/account) page under Account.

### Install the SDK

We currently support a native Python SDK. For other languages, we encourage using HTTP request libraries to send requests.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Python
pip install honeyhive
```
</CodeGroup>

### Trace your LangChain chains

If you haven't already done so, then the first thing you will need to do is <a href="/projects#create-a-new-project">create a HoneyHive project</a>.

Once you have created a HoneyHive project, you can now instrument tracing in your LangChain chain as so: 

<CodeGroup>
```python
from langchain import LLMMathChain, OpenAI, SerpAPIWrapper, Wikipedia
from langchain.agents import Tool, initialize_agent
from langchain.tools import StructuredTool
from langchain.agents.react.base import DocstoreExplorer
from langchain.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler
from honeyhive.sdk.langchain_tracer import HoneyHiveLangChainTracer

tracer = HoneyHiveLangChainTracer(
    project="Sandbox - Email Writer",  # necessary field: specify which project within HoneyHive
    name="Distance calculation",  # optional field: name of the chain/agent you are running
    source="testing",  # optional field: source (to separate production & testing in monitoring)
    user_properties={  # optional field: specify user properties for whom this was ran
        "user_id": "1234",
        "user_country": "US",
    },
   api_key="YOUR_HONEYHIVE_API_KEY",
)

# Initialise the OpenAI LLM and required callables for our tools
llm = OpenAI(
    temperature=0, openai_api_key="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
)
search = SerpAPIWrapper(
    serpapi_api_key="YOUR_SERP_API_KEY"
)
llm_math_chain = LLMMathChain.from_llm(llm=llm)
docstore = DocstoreExplorer(Wikipedia())

# Define the tools to be fed to the agent
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Google",
        func=search.run,
        description="Useful for when you need to answer questions about current events. You should ask targeted questions.",
    ),
    Tool(
        name="Wikipedia",
        func=docstore.search,
        description="Useful for when you need factual information. Ask search terms for Wikipedia",
    ),
    Tool(
        name="Calculator",
        func=llm_math_chain.run,
        description="Useful for when you need to answer questions about math.",
    ),
]

# Initialise the agent
agent = initialize_agent(tools=tools, llm=llm)
agent(
    "Which city is closest to London as the crow flies, Berlin or Munich?",
    callbacks=[tracer],
)
```
</CodeGroup>

You can now view this trace from within the HoneyHive platform by clicking on **Datasets** in the sidebar and then **Traces**.
