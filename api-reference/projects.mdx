All the prompts, datasets, fine tuned models and metrics in HoneyHive are organized by project.

## Creating a new project

To create a new project, click on the "New Project" button on the top right corner of the [home page](https://app.honeyhive.ai/).

You will be prompted to enter the name of the project, type and the description. With that, a new project is created.

# Project overview

### Prompts

You can go to the [Playground](https://app.honeyhive.ai/playground) to add prompts for the task or add them via the [prompts POST API](/api-reference/prompts/post).

Prompt management is done via the [Prompts](https://app.honeyhive.ai/prompts) page or the APIs.

### Datasets

To add datasets for [validation](https://app.honeyhive.ai/datasets/validation) or [fine-tuning](https://app.honeyhive.ai/datasets/finetuning), you can upload them via the webapp.

Alternatively, you can add them via the [datasets POST API](/api-reference/datasets/post) while specifying the purpose of the dataset.

Dataset management is done via the [Datasets](https://app.honeyhive.ai/datasets) page or the APIs.

### Fine-tuned models

You can trigger fine-tuning jobs via the [Fine-Tuning](https://app.honeyhive.ai/fine-tuning) page.
Currently, we don't have model import functionality. We are working on adding it.

### Metrics

Currently, metrics can only be ingested via the [metrics POST API](/api-reference/metrics/post). 
We are working on adding the metrics ingestion functionality via the webapp.
