After signing up on the app, you can find your API key in the [Settings](https://app.honeyhive.ai/settings/account) page.


## API Tokens

Please pass the API key as a header with each request as follows:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Token <YOUR_API_KEY>'
```

In case of the Python SDK, you can pass in the api key via the `api_key` parameter.

```Python
import honeyhive
honeyhive.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
honeyhive.openai_api_key = 'OPENAI_API_KEY'
```
