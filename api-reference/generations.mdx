## Creating generations

Once you have a project with a prompt setup and deployed, you can quickly get model text generation via our API.


- We automatically call the prompt that was deployed with the project, so you don't need to pass over the prompt name.

We can get generations by making a POST request to the [generations API](/api-reference/generations/post_saved) with the following body:

You only to pass over the input variables that were defined in the dynamic prompt template and task name in order to get generations.

```json
{
  "task": "find-animal",
  "input": {
    "color": "red",
    "animal": "cat"
  }
}
```

- You can also explicitly pass over other prompt names if you want to get generations from a different prompts.

```json
{
  "task": "find-animal",
  "prompt": ["my-prompt", "my-other-prompt"],
  "input": {
    "color": "red",
    "animal": "cat"
  }
}
```

- You can also pass over a prompt template directly if you don't want to use a prompt that was saved in the project with the [generate API](/api-reference/generations/post_generate).

```json
{
    "task": "text-generation",
    "model": "text-davinci-003",
    "prompt": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "hyperparameters": {
        "max_tokens": 10,
        "temperature": 0.9,
        "top_p": 0.9,
        "frequency_penalty": 0.0,
        "presence_penalty": 0.0,
        "stop": "###"
    },
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "source": "api"
}
```

## Ingesting generations

In case you want to migrate your previous generations datasets over, we offer an API to ingest generations into your project.

- You can ingest generations by making a POST request to the [bulk ingest API](/api-reference/generations/post_bulk).

Make sure that the input is marked as "prompt" and the output as "completion". You can ingest any other metadata you'd like on top of it.

```json
{
    "generations": [
        {
            "prompt": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
            "completion": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
            "metadata": {
                "source": "api"
            }
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Exporting generations

You can export generations from your project by making a GET request to the [generations GET API](/api-reference/generations/get).

Alternatively, you can also export generations from the UI by clicking on the "Export" button on the [generations](https://app.honeyhive.ai/datasets/generations) page.
