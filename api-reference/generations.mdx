## Creating generations

Once you have a project with a prompt setup and deployed, you can quickly get model text generation via our API.


### Deployed prompt generation

- We automatically call the prompt that was deployed with the project, so you don't need to pass over the prompt name.

We can get generations by making a POST request to the [generations API](/api-reference/generations/post_saved) with the following body:

You only to pass over the input variables that were defined in the dynamic prompt template and task name in order to get generations.

```json
{
  "task": "find-animal",
  "input": {
    "color": "red",
    "animal": "cat"
  }
}
```

### Specified prompt generation

- You can also explicitly pass over other prompt names if you want to get generations from a different prompts.

```json
{
  "task": "find-animal",
  "prompt": ["my-prompt", "my-other-prompt"],
  "input": {
    "color": "red",
    "animal": "cat"
  }
}
```

### Custom prompt generation

- You can also pass over a prompt template directly if you don't want to use a prompt that was saved in the project with the [generate API](/api-reference/generations/post_generate).

```json
{
    "task": "text-generation",
    "model": "text-davinci-003",
    "prompt": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
    "hyperparameters": {
        "max_tokens": 10,
        "temperature": 0.9,
        "top_p": 0.9,
        "frequency_penalty": 0.0,
        "presence_penalty": 0.0,
        "stop": "###"
    },
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "source": "api"
}
```

## Ingesting generations

In case you want to migrate your previous generations datasets over, we offer an API to ingest generations into your project.

- You can ingest generations by making a POST request to the [bulk ingest API](/api-reference/generations/post_bulk).

Make sure that the input is marked as "prompt" and the output as "completion". You can ingest any other metadata you'd like on top of it within "feedback".

Try to follow the below format.

```json
{
    "generations": [
        {
            "prompt": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
            "completion": "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.",
            "model": "text-davinci-003",
            "task": "text-generation",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "source": "api",
            "hyperparameters" : {
                "max_tokens": 10,
                "temperature": 0.9,
                "top_p": 0.9,
                "frequency_penalty": 0.0,
                "presence_penalty": 0.0,
                "stop": "###"
            },
            "feedback" : {
                "provided": true,
                "accepted": true,
                "user_country": "US"
            }
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Exporting generations

You can export generations from your project by making a GET request to the [generations GET API](/api-reference/generations/get).

Alternatively, you can also export generations from the UI by clicking on the "Export" button on the [generations](https://app.honeyhive.ai/datasets/generations) page.
