### Get API Key

After signing up on the app, you can find your API key in the [Settings](https://app.honeyhive.ai/settings/account) page under Account.

### Install the Python SDK

```bash
pip install honeyhive
```

### Replace `openai` with `honeyhive`

Replace your OpenAI calls with HoneyHive by simply renaming `openai` to `honeyhive` and adding parameters for `project` and `source`.

We are running the OpenAI call on your side and ingesting the response later.

```python
import honeyhive

honeyhive.api_key = "HONEYHIVE_API_KEY"
honeyhive.openai_api_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"

response = honeyhive.Completions.create(
    project="Sandbox - Email Writer",
    source="staging",
    model="text-davinci-003",
    prompt="This is a prompt",
)
```

### HoneyHive Prompt CI/CD alternative

Alternatively, you can leverage our prompt CI/CD capabilities and just call generation for a project without specifying all the parameters.

More documentation can be found on our [saved prompt generations API page](/api-reference/generations/post_saved).

```python
response = honeyhive.generations.generate(
    project="Sandbox - Email Writer",
    source="staging",
    input={
        "topic": "Model evaluation for companies using GPT-4",
        "tone": "friendly"
    },
)
```

### Provide feedback

Using the Generation ID that is returned, you can then send arbitrary feedback to HoneyHive using the `feedback` method. We recommend providing a unique user identifier along with each request as best-practice when deploying models to production.

```python
honeyhive.feedback(
    project="Sandbox - Email Writer",
    generation_id=response.generation_id,
    feedback_json={
        "accepted": True,
        "regenerated": False,
        "edited": False,
        "user_ID": "6402783619",
        "user_country": "US",
        "user_language": "en",
        "user_subscriptiontier": "Growth"
    }
)
```
