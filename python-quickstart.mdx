### Get API Key

After signing up on the app, you can find your API key in the [Settings](https://app.honeyhive.ai/settings/account) page under Account.

### Install the Python SDK

```bash
pip install honeyhive
```

### HoneyHive Proxy Method

You can leverage our prompt CI/CD capabilities and automatically call the current deployed prompt within a specified project without specifying all the parameters. Using this method, we automatically route your requests to the model-prompt configuration that you choose to deploy within the platform.

More documentation can be found on our [saved prompt generations API page](/api-reference/generations/post_saved).

```python
response = honeyhive.generations.generate(
    project="Sandbox - Email Writer",
    source="staging",
    input={
        "topic": "Model evaluation for companies using GPT-4",
        "tone": "friendly"
    },
)
```

### Ingest Model Completions

Alternatively, we provide you the option to run model completion requests within your own servers and ingest the response later without using HoneyHive's proxy server. To get started, simply replace your OpenAI calls with HoneyHive by renaming `openai` to `honeyhive` and adding parameters for `project` and `source`.

```python
import honeyhive

honeyhive.api_key = "HONEYHIVE_API_KEY"
honeyhive.openai_api_key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"

response = honeyhive.Completions.create(
    project="Sandbox - Email Writer",
    source="staging",
    model="text-davinci-003",
    prompt="This is a prompt",
)
```

### Provide feedback

Using the Generation ID that is returned, you can then send arbitrary feedback to HoneyHive using the `feedback` method. We recommend providing a unique user identifier along with each request as best-practice when deploying models to production.

```python
honeyhive.feedback(
    project="Sandbox - Email Writer",
    generation_id=response.generation_id,
    feedback_json={
        "accepted": True,
        "regenerated": False,
        "edited": False,
        "user_ID": "6402783619",
        "user_country": "US",
        "user_language": "en",
        "user_subscriptiontier": "Growth"
    }
)
```
